Members of private groups or public groups with private members can be listed by users, who can create and edit post events. This vulnerability only affects sites which have discourse post events enabled. This issue has been patched in commit `ca5ae3e7e` which will be included in future releases. Users unable to upgrade should disable the `discourse_post_event_enabled` setting to fully mitigate the issue. Also, it's possible to prevent regular users from using this vulnerability by removing all groups from the `discourse_post_event_allowed_on_groups` but note that moderators will still be able to use it."

The vulnerability does not affect the Splunk Cloud Platform. At the time of publishing, we have no evidence of exploitation of this vulnerability by external parties. The issue requires conditions beyond the control of a potential bad actor such as a machine-in-the-middle attack. Hence, Splunk rates the complexity of the attack as High."

Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to passport-saml version 3.2.2 or newer. The issue was also present in the beta releases of `node-saml` before version 4.0.0-beta.5.
